  - Error scenario coverage: validation errors, service failures, feature disabled states
  - Mock integration: clean separation between unit and integration concerns

### T2.3: Analytics Middleware
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Files**: `src/server/middleware/analyticsMiddleware.ts`
- **Achievement**: Production-ready middleware stack with security and performance controls
- **Features**:
  - **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/15min (standard), 20 requests/hour (expensive operations)
  - **Request Validation**: Zod schema validation with detailed error responses
  - **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and analytics-specific headers
  - **Performance Monitoring**: Request timing and latency tracking with metrics
  - **Feature Flag Protection**: Environment-based analytics feature toggles
  - **IPv6 Compatibility**: Resolved rate limiting issues for IPv6 addresses

### T2.4: Analytics Service Layer  
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Files**: `src/server/services/analyticsService.ts`
- **Achievement**: Clean service abstraction with caching support and comprehensive analytics
- **Features**:
  - **AnalyticsService Class**: Centralized business logic with static methods
  - **Player Analytics**: Activity patterns, race distribution, ranking movement, league statistics
  - **Activity Analysis**: Temporal patterns, engagement metrics, retention analysis, time buckets
  - **Performance Optimization**: Cache key generation following CacheKeys utility patterns
  - **Error Handling**: Proper error tracking and logging integration
  - **Data Integration**: Uses existing DataDerivationsService and pulseApi infrastructure

### T2.5: Analytics Metrics Integration
- **Status**: COMPLETED  
- **Files**: `src/server/metrics/lite.ts`, `src/server/routes/debugHandler.ts`
- **Achievement**: Analytics monitoring integrated into existing observability infrastructure
- **Features**:
  - **Request Tracking**: Total requests, cache hit/miss rates, error counts
  - **Performance Monitoring**: Latency histograms with P50/P95/P99 percentiles (target <250ms)
  - **Rate Limiting Metrics**: Blocked request tracking and feature flag monitoring
  - **Debug Integration**: Analytics metrics exposed in existing `/debug?type=metrics` endpoint
  - **Lite.js Pattern**: Consistent with existing infrastructure monitoring approach

## 🎯 Key Achievements

### Security & Performance
1. **Rate Limiting**: Express-rate-limit integration with custom key generation
2. **Input Validation**: Zod schemas preventing malformed requests and injection attacks
3. **Security Headers**: Comprehensive protection against XSS, clickjacking, and CSRF
4. **Performance Targets**: Sub-250ms latency for standard operations, <1000ms for expensive

### Service Architecture  
1. **Clean Separation**: Routes → Middleware → Service → Data layers
2. **Cache Integration**: Follows established CacheKeys utility patterns for consistency
3. **Error Standards**: Standardized HTTP status codes and error message formats
4. **Feature Flags**: `ENABLE_PLAYER_ANALYTICS` for safe production rollouts

### Monitoring & Observability
1. **Metrics Integration**: Analytics-specific counters in existing lite.ts infrastructure
2. **Request Lifecycle**: Complete tracking from rate limiting through response generation
3. **Error Classification**: Validation, service, network, and other error categories
4. **Debug Accessibility**: Real-time metrics via established debug endpoint

## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoints
```
GET /api/player-analytics
  Query: timeframe=current|daily, includeInactive=boolean, minimumGames=number, race=TERRAN|PROTOSS|ZERG|RANDOM
  Response: Comprehensive player statistics with activity, ratings, games, league performance

GET /api/player-analytics/activity  
  Query: includeInactive=boolean, groupBy=race|league|activity, timeframe=current|daily, minimumGames=number
  Response: Detailed activity analysis with temporal patterns and engagement metrics
```

### Middleware Stack
```
1. requireAnalyticsFeature - Feature flag validation
2. standardAnalyticsMiddleware/expensiveAnalyticsMiddleware - Rate limiting + validation + security + performance monitoring
3. Route Handler - Business logic execution
4. Error Handling - Standardized error responses
```

### Metrics Collection
```
analytics_req_total: Total analytics requests processed
analytics_cache_hit_rate: Percentage of cache hits vs misses  
analytics_rate_limited: Requests blocked by rate limiting
analytics_feature_disabled: Requests blocked by feature flags
analytics_error_rate: Percentage of requests resulting in errors
analytics_p50/p95/p99_ms: Latency percentiles for performance monitoring
```
