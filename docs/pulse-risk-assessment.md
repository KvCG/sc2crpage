# Pulse Integration Risk Assessment

## Executive Summary

The SC2CR application has significant dependencies on the SC2Pulse API for core functionality. This assessment identifies critical risk areas that could impact system reliability, data integrity, and user experience. Most risks stem from external dependencies and lack of redundancy in data sources.

**Risk Level: HIGH** - Multiple single points of failure with limited mitigation strategies.

## Critical Risk Areas

### 1. External API Dependencies 游댮 HIGH RISK

**SC2Pulse API Availability**
- **Risk**: Community-maintained API with no SLA or uptime guarantees
- **Impact**: Complete loss of ranking data, search functionality, and live updates
- **Current Exposure**: No fallback mechanisms or cached static data for outages
- **Indicators**: 
  - API response times increasing to >2000ms  
  - Error rates exceeding 5% over sustained periods
  - Consecutive failures indicating service degradation

**Rate Limiting Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk**: Hard 10 RPS limit with aggressive enforcement
- **Impact**: Request throttling during peak usage, degraded user experience
- **Current Mitigation**: Client-side rate limiting with exponential backoff
- **Gap**: No request queuing or intelligent retry strategies for burst traffic

### 2. Data Consistency Issues 游리 MEDIUM-HIGH RISK

**Cache Coherence Problems**
- **Risk**: 30-second TTL creates windows of stale data during high load
- **Impact**: Position indicators showing incorrect deltas, outdated rankings
- **Scenario**: Rapid ranking changes not reflected until cache expires
- **Mitigation Gap**: No cache invalidation strategy for data freshness requirements

**Race Extraction Logic Fragility**
- **Risk**: Business logic tightly coupled to upstream API response format
- **Code Location**: `extractRace()` function in `pulseApi.ts`
- **Breaking Changes**:
  ```typescript
  // Current dependency on specific field names
  if (highestRatingObj?.raceGames) {
      return Object.keys(highestRatingObj.raceGames)[0] ?? null
  }
  ```
- **Impact**: Null race values break UI components expecting string types
- **Frequency**: Upstream schema changes without notification

**Player Identity Resolution**
- **Risk**: CSV dependency for battleTag/name mapping creates data inconsistency
- **File**: `dist/data/ladderCR.csv` 
- **Failure Mode**: Missing or outdated CSV data results in incomplete player profiles
- **Recovery**: Manual intervention required to restore identity mappings

### 3. Performance Bottlenecks 游리 MEDIUM RISK

**Sequential Batch Processing**
- **Risk**: Player stats fetched in sequential chunks due to API limits
- **Code Pattern**:
  ```typescript
  for (const chunk of chunks) {
      const params = chunk.map(id => `characterId=${id}`).join('&')
      // Sequential HTTP requests - no parallelization
  }
  ```
- **Impact**: Linear scaling of response time with player count
- **Threshold**: >100 players = >10 seconds response time

**Memory Consumption**
- **Risk**: Full dataset caching with no size limits or eviction policies
- **Growth Pattern**: Linear with active player base
- **Failure Mode**: Node.js heap exhaustion during peak loads
- **Current Limit**: No monitoring of cache memory usage

**Anti-Stampede Effectiveness**
- **Risk**: Shared promise mechanism may not handle concurrent failures
- **Code Location**: `inflightPromise` in `getTop()`
- **Edge Case**: Promise rejection leaves subsequent requests without protection
- **Impact**: Request multiplication during error conditions

### 4. Error Handling Gaps 游리 MEDIUM RISK

**Incomplete Retry Strategies**
- **Current**: Basic retry for 429/5xx with exponential backoff
- **Missing**: Circuit breaker pattern for sustained failures
- **Risk**: Continued API hammering during outages
- **Code Gap**:
  ```typescript
  // Only retries specific HTTP status codes
  const isRetriableStatus = (status?: number) =>
      status === 429 || (typeof status === 'number' && status >= 500)
  ```

**Error Propagation**
- **Risk**: Service errors bubble up without graceful degradation
- **Impact**: Complete feature unavailability instead of partial functionality
- **Example**: Search failure prevents any player lookup vs showing cached results

**Data Validation**
- **Risk**: Malformed upstream responses not validated before processing
- **Code Gap**: No schema validation for API responses
- **Impact**: Runtime errors from null pointer exceptions, type mismatches

### 5. Operational Blind Spots 游리 MEDIUM RISK

**Limited Observability**
- **Current**: Basic counters and latency bins
- **Missing**: 
  - Request tracing across service boundaries
  - Data quality metrics (completeness, accuracy)
  - User impact correlation (search success rates, response times)

**No Health Checks**
- **Risk**: No programmatic way to assess system health
- **Impact**: Manual intervention required for status assessment
- **Missing**: Automated alerting for degraded performance

**Deployment Dependencies**
- **Risk**: CSV file management requires manual intervention
- **Process**: File placement after build, Firebase download on first run
- **Failure Mode**: Missing data file prevents application startup

## Risk Mitigation Priorities

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Implement Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   ```typescript
   class PulseCircuitBreaker {
       private failureCount = 0
       private lastFailureTime = 0
       private readonly threshold = 5
       private readonly timeout = 30000
   }
   ```

2. **Add Response Schema Validation**
   ```typescript
   function validatePulseResponse(data: unknown): boolean {
       // Validate required fields and types
       return isValidPlayerData(data)
   }
   ```

3. **Enhance Error Boundaries**
   ```typescript
   // Graceful degradation with cached fallbacks
   async function getTopWithFallback(): Promise<RankingData[]> {
       try {
           return await getTop()
       } catch (error) {
           return getCachedFallback() || getStaticFallback()
       }
   }
   ```
