# SC2CR Feature List & Prioritization

## High Priority
- Ranking pages with filters/sorting/pagination
  - Core for both competitive and casual users; enables engagement and progress tracking.
- Player search & profiles (cross-realm, historical data)
  - Essential for rivalry, self-improvement, and social features.
- Head-to-head tracking and leaderboards
  - Drives competition and community interaction.
- Aggregate/player-level analytics (MMR delta, streaks, activity, confidence)
  - Adds value for competitive players and supports data-driven engagement.
- Snapshot history with retention and movers
  - Enables historical context and rank change tracking.
- Responsive/mobile-first design
  - Ensures accessibility and usability for all users.
- Accessibility (WCAG, ARIA, keyboard support)
  - Required for inclusivity and best practices.

## Medium Priority
- Admin/observability tools (scheduler, retention, backup status)
  - Needed for maintainers, but not for most users; supports reliability.
- Community features: custom leaderboards, weekly challenges
  - Boosts engagement, but can be phased in as resources allow.
- Achievements/badges
  - Adds fun and recognition, but not core to initial launch.

## Low Priority
- Advanced analytics (team chemistry, regional trends, skill clustering)
  - Valuable for future expansion, but not essential for MVP.
- Social sharing/invite features
  - Nice-to-have for growth, but not critical for core experience.
- In-app notifications
  - Useful for engagement, but can be added after core flows are stable.

---

**Rationale:**
- High priority features are essential for core user journeys and community engagement.
- Medium priority features enhance experience and admin control, but can be added iteratively.
- Low priority features are future-facing, supporting growth and deeper analytics as resources allow.
