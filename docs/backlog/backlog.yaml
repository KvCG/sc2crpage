    title: Minimal CI stability and linting
    type: techdebt
    area: ops
    priority: P0
    why: Keep PR CI green with flat ESLint config and TS checks.
    acceptance:
      - CI runs lint, typecheck, build on PRs to dev/main
      - eslint config uses flat ESM; no config errors
      - Lint has 0 errors (warnings allowed)
      - Repo builds without interactive input

    title: Server test suite expansion
    type: techdebt
    area: server
    priority: P1
    why: Cover routes/middleware/services, esp. SC2Pulse caching and error mapping.
    acceptance:
      - Vitest server suite covers pulseRoutes, pulseApi, error handlers
      - v8 coverage  60% server-side
      - Tests run non-interactively via npm scripts

    title: Client coverage scoping and scaffolding
    type: techdebt
    area: client
    priority: P1
    why: Avoid noise from non-client files and build a base for RTL/MSW tests.
    acceptance:
      - vitest.client.config.ts coverage.include limited to src/client/**
      - Pass with no tests enabled; sample test scaffold added
    status: planned

    acceptance:
      - Branch protections on main/dev (required CI, review, linear history)
      - Dependabot alerts enabled and visible
      - Secret scanning + push protection on
